Update the existing Manager Portal UI and functionality for a hotel task management system.
Do NOT change authentication logic or header layout.

Goal:
Create a clean, responsive Manager Dashboard that works well on BOTH desktop web and mobile web, with a mobile-first approach.

========================
ROLE RULES (IMPORTANT)
========================
- Manager manages ONLY their assigned department
- Manager can see ONLY:
  - Tickets from their department
  - Staff from their department
- Manager CANNOT:
  - Access admin settings
  - See other departments
  - Invite/remove users
  - Change roles or business settings

========================
HEADER (DO NOT REDESIGN)
========================
- Keep existing header style
- Left: Logo + business name
- Center: "Manager Portal"
- Right: Profile + Logout

========================
MAIN SECTIONS (TABS / ROUTES)
========================
1. Tickets
2. Team
3. Stats
4. Settings

Use the same routes for desktop and mobile.
Only layout should change responsively.

========================
1. TICKETS SECTION (PRIMARY)
========================
Show a list of tickets ONLY from the manager’s department.

Each ticket row must show:
- Room number
- Guest request (short text)
- Priority (Urgent / Normal / Low with color)
- Status (New / Assigned / In Progress / Completed)
- Assigned staff (if any)
- Time created

Manager actions:
- Assign ticket to staff (same department only)
- Reassign ticket
- Change ticket status
- Add internal note
- Message assigned staff

UX rules:
- Mobile: tap ticket → open bottom sheet
- Desktop: click ticket → open side panel
- No long forms
- Actions must be 1–2 clicks max

Filters:
- Status
- Priority
- Assigned / Unassigned

========================
2. TEAM SECTION
========================
Show a clean, compact list (NOT cards) of department staff.

Each staff row:
- Name
- Role
- Department
- Online / Offline status
- Active task count

Manager actions:
- Assign tickets to staff
- Message staff
- View workload

Restrictions:
- Cannot add/remove users
- Cannot change roles

========================
3. STATS SECTION (SIMPLE ONLY)
========================
Show ONLY department-level stats:
- Tickets today
- Completed today
- Pending tickets

========================

RESPONSIVE DESIGN RULES
========================
Mobile Web:
- Single column layout
- Bottom navigation bar:
  - Tickets
  - Team
  - Stats

- Large touch targets (48px+)
- Bottom sheets for actions
- No tables

Desktop Web:
- Sidebar navigation instead of bottom nav

Same logic, same routes, same data — layout only changes.
